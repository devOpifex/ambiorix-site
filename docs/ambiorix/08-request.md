# Request

This details the request object, generally the first argument
of the functions passed to paths (`app$get("/", \(req, res){})`).

:::tip

In the early very of the request was a locked environment so
one could only read from it.
Now, the environment is not locked and variables can be added
to the response, e.g.: `req$x <- 1L`.

## Object

Easiest to see what is available is to `print` the object.

```r
library(ambiorix)

app <- Ambiorix$new()

app$get("/", \(req, res){
  print(req)
  res$send("Using {ambiorix}!")
})

app$start()
```

```

Make sure you do not overwrite existing data.

```r
app <- Ambiorix$new()

app$use(\(req, res){
  # set
  req$user <- "John"
})

app$get("/", \(req, res){
  # get
  print(req$user)
  res$send("Hello {ambiorix}")
})

app$start()
```

__Counter__

This is an example of creating a counter; every refresh bumps the counter,
using a middleware means we cound visits overall, not just to the main page.

```r
app <- Ambiorix$new()

val <- 0L

app$use(\(req, res){
  val <<- val + 1L
  req$x <- val
})

app$get("/", \(req, res){
  res$send_sprintf(
    "Count %s",
    req$x
  )
})

app$get("/add", \(req, res){
  res$send_sprintf(
    "Added one!",
  )
})

app$start()
```
