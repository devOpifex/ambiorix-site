# Response

Every route (`get`, `post`, etc.) handler should accept the request (`req`) and the response (`res`). Note that routes may optionally accept a different handler for errors.

:::tip

In the early very of the response was a locked environment so
one could only read from it.
Now, the environment is not locked and variables can be added
to the response, e.g.: `res$x <- 1L`.
This is useful to use with middlewares so one can set variables
in one place and pick up at specific paths.

:::

## HTML

One can send plain HTML with `send`.

```r
app$get("/html", \(req, res){
  res$send("hello!")
})
```

## Text

One can send a plain text with `text`.

```r
app$get("/text", \(req, res){
  res$text("hello!")
})
```

## File

An `.html` or `.R` file can also be used as response.

```r
# sends templates/home.html
app$get("/file", \(req, res){
  res$send_file("home.html")
})
```

## Render

An `.html` or `.R` file can also be rendered. The difference with `send_file` is that it will use `data` to process `[% tags %]`. You can read more it in the templates documentation.

```r
# renders templates/home.html
# replaces [% title %]
app$get("/:book", \(req, res){
  res$render("home.html", data = list(title = req$params$book))
})
```

## JSON

You can also send JSON responses with `json`, e.g.: to build an api

```r
app$get("/:book", \(req, res){
  res$json(cars)
})
```

## Status

The status of the response can be specified in the response method (e.g.: `render('home', status = 200L)`), or with the `status` method.

```r
app$get("/error", \(req, res){
  res$status(500)
  res$send("Error!")
})

# or
app$get("/error", \(req, res){
  res$send("Error!", status = 500L)
})
```

## Redirect

One can also redirect to a different url, note that these should have a `status` starting in `3`.

```r
app$get("/redirect", \(req, res){
  res$redirect("/", status = 302L)
})
```

## CSV

Serialises to CSV, when this endpoint is visited the CSV file is downloaded. It takes the data as first argument and the name of the file to download as second argument.

```r
app$get("/csv", \(req, res){
  res$csv(cars, "cars-data")
})
```

## TSV

Serialises to tab separated file; it takes the same arguments as the csv response.

```r
app$get("/tsv", \(req, res){
  res$tsv(mtcars, "more-cars")
})
```

## htmlwidget

Serialises an htmlwidget.

```r
library(echarts4r)

app$get("/htmlwidget", \(req, res){
  plot <- e_charts(cars, speed) %>% 
    e_scatter(dist)
  res$htmlwidget(plot)
})
```

## Headers

You can add headers with the `header` method on the response object.

```r
app$get("/hello", \(req, res){
  res$header("Content-Type", "something")
  res$send("Using {ambiorix}!")
})
```
