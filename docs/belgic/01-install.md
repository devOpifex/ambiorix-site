# Install

Belgic is built with Go, use it to install it or
download the binary

## Go

```bash
go get github.com/ambiorix-web/belgic
```

or

``` bash
go install github.com/ambiorix-web/belgic@latest
```

## Binaries

Alternatively download one of the 
[available binaries](https://github.com/ambiorix-web/belgic/tree/master/bin)
for your operating system.

You will likely want to run that from a Linux server and therefore
just run `./belgic`.
