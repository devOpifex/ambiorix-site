# Generator

An R package to conveniently create ambiorix projects.

It comes with just handful of functions to create projects but
one is recommended over the others; 
the function `create_package` creates an ambiorix project
in the form of an R package so one can leverage all the 
R toolchain for documenting, testing, etc.
